INDI Astroberry 1.0.5
=================================
This package provides the INDI drivers for Raspberry Pi devices:
* Astroberry Focuser - stepper motor driver with absolute and relative position capabilities and autofocus with INDI client such as KStars and Ekos

============
v1.1
all		- Initial release of astroberry drivers

Requirements
============
* INDI available here http://indilib.org/download.html

How to Use
==========
Once installed, the Astroberry INDI drivers can be used by an INDI client such as. 
It can also be used manually by invoking it via the indi_server:
$ indi_server indi_rpifocus


Important!!!
============
Astroberry drivers are dedicated for controlling Raspberry Pi based devices. Drivers access various GPIO pins. Make sure 
that you use appropriate hardware devices connected to correct Raspberry Pi GPIO pins before running these drivers.
See Hardware specs below for detailed hardware and wiring instructions.

Hardware specs for Astroberry drivers
======================================
All devices have been connected to Raspberry Pi 3 running Ubuntu Mate

1. Astroberry Focuser
* Stepper motor - PG2528-0502U 5V 0.2A 0,5Nm (with builtin gear 76:1)
* Stepper motor controller - Low-Voltage DRV8834 10,8V 2A.
  Wiring Raspberry Pi to the motor controller:
  GPIO04 - DIR
  GPIO17 - STEP
  GPIO22 - M0
  GPIO27 - M1
  GPIO23 - SLEEP
  Note: Make sure you connect the stepper motor correctly to the controller (B2, B1 and A2, A1 pins on the controller).
        Remember to protect the 5V power line connected to VMOT pin on the motor controller with 100uF capacitor.
